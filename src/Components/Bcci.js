                The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)[13] is the national governing body of Cricket in India.[14] Its headquarters is situated at the Cricket centre in Churchgate, Mumbai.[15] The BCCI is the wealthiest governing body of cricket in the world.[16][17][18]

                The BCCI was formed in December 1928 and is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[19] As of February 2023, Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.[20][21] The board joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926.[2] The BCCI is an autonomous, private organisation that does not fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India and the Government of India has minimal regulation on it. It does not receive any grants or funds from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket.[22][23][24] ICC share biggest part of its revenue with the BCCI. Its IPL is one of the wealthiest sports league in the world.[25] In 2023, BCCI sold Indian cricket's media rights to Viacom18 for more than ₹6,000 crore (US$750 million), WPL media rights was sold for ₹951 to Viacom18 in 2023 and in 2022 IPL media rights was sold to Viacom18–Star sports for ₹48,390 crore (US$6.1 billion). All the media rights are awarded for 5 years.[26][27][28]The BCCI pays hundreds of crores rupees in the form of tax to the government of India, paying ₹4,000 crore (US$500 million) in financial year 2022-23.[29][details 1]

                The BCCI has hosted multiple ICC World Cups,[a] and will host the 2023 Cricket World Cup, the 2026 ICC T20 World cup, the 2031 ICC ODI Cricket World Cup,[b] and the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup.[31][c]

                The BCCI manages four squads that represent India in international cricket; the men's national cricket team, the women's national cricket team, the men's national under-19 cricket team and women's national under-19 cricket team. It also governs developmental India A, India B and India A women's teams.[32] Its national selection committee, which is led by chief national selector, selects players for these teams.[d] As part of its duties, the BCCI organises and schedules matches to be played by each of these teams, and schedules, sanctions and organises domestic cricket in India.
